## About 
I am a full stack developer who has recently embarked in a new career in software development. My previous career was working within Local Government and it became quite apparent to me that the use of archaic systems, databases and limited use of creativity gave me the motivation to set sail on a thriving, fulfilling and exciting chapter in my life. 

## Projects
During my time with Makers, I collaborated on several projects using various lanaguages, frameworks and tools. You can follow my progress through my [GitHub](github.com/jordanveness), but here is a select few I am particularly proud of 😁
