## About 
I am a full stack developer who has recently embarked in a new career in software development. My previous career was working within Local Government and it became quite apparent to me that the use of archaic systems, databases and limited use of creativity gave me the motivation to set sail on a thriving, fulfilling and exciting chapter in my life. 

## Projects
During my time with Makers, I collaborated on several projects using various lanaguages, frameworks and tools. You can follow my progress through my [GitHub](github.com/jordanveness), but here is a select few I am particularly proud of üòÅ

| Project     | Description  | Tech  |
|:------------|:-------------|:-------|
| [KickAbout](https://github.com/lildann/kickabout)   | A web application targetted at the non-traditional football audience. It is designed to set up and join football matches near to your location using the Google Maps API | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, HTML, SASS |
| [IOBook](https://github.com/tomal02/iobook) | Inspired by Facebook, a social network platform hosted on [Heroku](https://iobook.herokuapp.com/) | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, Heroku |
| [Notes App](https://github.com/Maby0/notesApp) | A single page web application that stores notes | HTML, CSS, Pure Javascript |

## Skills
### Planning
Whilst working in Local Government, one of my duties was to deliver elections at European, National and Local levels. To ensure this was delivered to the highest standard and complied with legislation, planning played a key role. Project planning was one of my responsibilities producing methodical plans for up to 6 months for the team to work towards providing estimates, leads and deadlines. Having experience with this and also completing the Prince 2 qualification in Project Management at University allowed me to apply these skills to Makers.

At Makers, a lot of group projects would involve time before writing any code to plan towards our Minimum Viable Product. Using tools such a Trello and Balsamiq would provide a visual representation of our objectives, to-do lists, blockers and design frames. Using Agile processes such as daily stand-ups and retros allowed everyone to check in with how the project is going and provided an opportunity for anyone to address any concerns they had whilst helping with general well-being. 

I have learnt many different techniques on how to plan since being with Makers whilst having my own from my previous career and university experience. I am meticulous in how I approach problems so will always ensure I have a plan before beginning things. 

### Communication
In previous roles, communication has always been essential. During my time in Elections, I would be involved in regular communication with the Electoral Commission and the Cabinet Office to ensure we complied with their guidance and legislation. Alongside political parties, this includes MP's, MEP's, Borough and Parish Councillors to provide guidance and support wherever possible. And a whole list of other stakeholders who will be involved in the Democratic Process, such as the general public, venues, suppliers and internal departments. 

My role as an aspiring developer would stress the importance of communication, especially at Makers. I would be leading daily stand-ups and retros and spend a lot of time on reflection with my group. Alongside this, collaborating with other aspiring developers has allowed me to pick up on different techniques and approaches which I can implement in my lifestyle.

Since graduating from Makers, I have developed my communication skills by working within a team in just a remote setting, whilst also improving on other aspects of communication. Learning to listen, Makers is an environment where everyone is felt to be made welcome. The pairing element of Makers ensures that you collaborate with many other devs. It stresses the importance of respecting people including someone like me, an extroverted introvert and learning to listen. 

### Attention to detail
As an Elections Officer, I would oversee the publication of the electoral register supplied to Central Government, Political Parties and Credit Agencies. Produce and distribute public notices online and offline. Meet prospective candidates to ensure their nomination papers to stand for election are correct. Proofread 10,000's of ballot papers to ensure the spelling of candidates, the correct political parties named, the area, serial numbers and prefixes are all accurate. This has allowed me to have a good eye for detail and ensure that I can pick things up that may be incorrect or question things that may not make sense to me.

On my journey to becoming an aspiring software developer, having attention to detail has proved to be extremely important. An example of this, although simple can be the most difficult error to debug. Spotting spelling mistakes, white spaces, indentations can be trivial on occasions but being able to spot them has made my journey of de-bugging much more simple allowing me to delve deeper into the issue if it persists. 

### Problem Solving
Delivering elections can be troublemsome and I would often encounter unexpected issues. An example of this is the 2021 May elections which were during a time where COVID had forced the country to go into a lockdown 2 months prior. I would oversee campaigns pushing for postal voting to avoid voters attending polling stations to vote, along with putting in place measures to ensure social distancing at polling stations so it was safe. Typically I would not usually implement social distancing measures, getting PPE from suppliers and distributing it to venues etc. but this has enabled me to approach any problems that I encounter without fear and think logically on how to solve them. 

At Makers I would frequenlty apporach problems systematically. If I encountered an issue I would time box my learning, see what the best approach would be an attempt that. On occassions I would step away from the screen for 5 minutes and this would also help solve the problem. I found a good balance that works for me.
